// It contains the reusable atomic & molecular components.

/** Atomic Components: Atoms are the smallest,
 * most basic components that cannot be broken down any further.
 * Examples of atoms include buttons, inputs, labels, and icons.
 */
/** Molecular Components: Molecules are made up of two or more atoms combined together.
 * They are more complex than atoms, but they are still relatively simple and reusable.
 * Examples of molecules include form fields, buttons with labels, and pagination controls.
